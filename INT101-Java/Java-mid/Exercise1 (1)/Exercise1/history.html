        <h1>The History of Big Data</h1>

        <p>Although the concept of big data itself is relatively new, the origins of large data sets go back to the 1960s and '70s when the world of data was just getting started with the first data centers and the development of the relational database.
        </p>

        <p> 2005, people began to realize just how much data users generated through <a href="https://www.facebook.com"> Facebook</a>, YouTube, and other online services. Hadoop (an open-source framework created specifically to store and analyze big data sets) was developed that same year. NoSQL also began to gain popularity during this time.
        </p>

        <p>The development of open-source frameworks, such as Hadoop (and more recently, Spark) was essential for the growth of big data because they make big data easier to work with and cheaper to store. In the years since then, the volume of big data has skyrocketed. Users are still generating huge amounts of data—but it’s not just humans who are doing it.
        </p>

        <p>With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), more objects and devices are connected to the internet, gathering data on customer usage patterns and product performance. The emergence of machine learning has produced still more data.
        </p>
        
        <p>While big data has come far, its usefulness is only just beginning. Cloud computing has expanded big data possibilities even further. The cloud offers truly elastic scalability, where developers can simply spin up ad hoc clusters to test a subset of data.

        <h2>Benefits of Big Data and Data Analytics:</h2>
        

        <p>Big data makes it possible for you to gain more complete answers because you have more information.
        More complete answers mean more confidence in the data—which means a completely different approach to tackling problems.
