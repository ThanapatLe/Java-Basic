	<h1> exactly is big data?</h1>

	<p>To really understand big data, it’s helpful to have some historical background.
	Here is Gartner’s definition, circa
	2001 (which is still the go-to definition): Big data is data that contains greater
	variety arriving in increasing
	volumes and with ever-higher velocity. This is known as the three Vs.</p>

	<p> simply, big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources.
	These data sets are so voluminous that traditional data processing software
	just can’t manage them. But these massive volumes of data can be used to address business
	problems you wouldn’t have been able to tackle before.</p>
